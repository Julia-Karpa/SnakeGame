 ## Aim of Site:

My aim was to replicate the classic Nokia phone snake game, but make it so that you can play it in your web browser on your PC. 
To add a twist to the game, the player has to answer three snake-themed, multiple-choice questions correctly before they can get access to the game. This helps add a small educational element to the game.

## User Stories:

1. I want to play the snake phone game on my PC.
2. I want to be able to see my highest score, as this will make the game more meaningful and give me something to aim for.

## Logo & Colours:

I used Adobe AI generator to create my snake logo.

I wanted a logo that would match my overall page colour scheme. I went for pink and green, as pink softens and warms up a green tone, while green keeps the pink grounded and earthy.

## Wireframes:

## Future Enhancements:

1. Add the ability to store the user's highest score after the user leaves the browser.
2. Add more snake questions (there is only a choice of nine questions that get selected at random). Therefore, the quiz wouldn't be fun or challenging for users who play the game frequently.
3. As the user scores more points, add obstacles to the grid for the snake to avoid.Â
