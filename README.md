 ##Aim of Site:

My aim was to replicate the classic Nokia phone snake game, but make it so that you can play it in your web browser on your PC. 
To add a twist to the game, the player has to answer three snake-themed, multiple-choice questions correctly before they can get access to the game. This helps add a small educational element to the game.

## User stories:

1. I want to play the phone snake game on my PC.
2. I want to be able to see my highest score, as this will make the game more meaningful and give me something to aim for.

## Logo and colours:

I used Adobe AI generator to create my snake logo.

I wanted a logo that would match my overall page color scheme. I went for pink and green, as pink softens and warms up a green tone, while green keeps the pink grounded and earthy.
