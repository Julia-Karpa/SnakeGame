 ## Aim of Site:

My aim was to replicate the classic Nokia phone snake game, but make it so that you can play it in your web browser on your PC. 
To add a twist to the game, the player has to answer three snake-themed, multiple-choice questions correctly before they can get access to the game. This helps add a small educational element to the game.

## User Stories:

1. I want to play the snake phone game on my PC.
2. I want to be able to see my highest score, as this will make the game more meaningful and give me something to aim for.
3. I want to play a simple game, with no complex instruction.
4. I want something to do whilst I have a few free minutes.

## Logo & Colours:

I used Adobe AI generator to create my snake logo.

I wanted a logo that would match my overall page colour scheme. I went for pink and green, as pink softens and warms up a green tone, while green keeps the pink grounded and earthy.

## Languages Used:

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript


## Wireframes:

## Future Enhancements:

1. Add the ability to store the user's highest score after the user leaves the browser.
2. Add more snake questions (there is only a choice of nine questions that get selected at random). Therefore, the quiz wouldn't be fun or challenging for users who play the game frequently.
3. As the user scores more points, add obstacles to the grid for the snake to avoid.Â 
4. Occasionally, the same question repeats twice in a row, and ideally, this shouldn't happen.


## Testing Phase:

I used Google Lighthouse to test the performance of my pages. Here are the results:

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. All my pages showed the following results:
